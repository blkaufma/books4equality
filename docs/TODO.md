We have the sign-up form, which add an organization with the following information:
- Organization name = username
- Contact email
- Password
Optional:
- Logo
- Location of the box where they can donate books (For now it's fine with one)
Init to 0:
- outreach
- numberBooks

We need to be able to print that information as a table. 
- numBooks will change from python
- outreach will change (+1) when people like the group with their account (we still don't allow to register users).
