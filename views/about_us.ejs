<section>
	<h5>Founding Members</h5>
	<p>Alex, Ben, and Javier met during their first weekend as students at the University of Vermont playing pick up soccer and quickly became friends. They became closer in their years in college through hiking, intramurals, traveling, and more. Three very different individuals with different backgrounds form a strong team with experience in business, entrepreneurship, website design, computer science, marketing, and interests that cover even more fields.

		  <p>Javier B, a UVM graduate with a M.Sc in Computer Science, was one of the original members of the B4E team. He met this awesome group of people in 2014, and spent many hours coding, filling up forms, reaching out to professors, students, and Burlington businesses. His role at Books4Equality is to collect and analyze data to move the organization further along. Currently a resident of Amsterdam, Javi gives support from the other side of the ocean. Among other plans for B4E, he would like to start an online community around open-source, modular, high-quality textbooks.
