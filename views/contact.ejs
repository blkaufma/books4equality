Alex, Ben, and Javier met during their first weekend as students at the University of Vermont playing pick up soccer and quickly became friends. They became closer in their years in college through hiking, intramurals, traveling, and more. Three very different individuals with different backgrounds form a strong team with experience in business, entrepreneurship, website design, computer science, marketing, and interests that cover even more fields.
