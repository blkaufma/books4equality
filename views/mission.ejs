<p class="lead"> <strong>What do we do</strong><br></p>
<p>
Books 4 Equality is a free library with an online database for anyone to search, view, and borrow real books from. We solicit donations from all kinds of books in usable condition, then donate those same books to those who borrow them from our website. Catering towards making college more affordable for students, we have a strong presence and continue to grow on college campuses.
</p>
<p>
Some books are older and not frequently used in colleges and universities. In an effort to keep the pages turning, these books will be donated to schools, libraries, and other organizations around the world.

<p class="lead"> <strong>Philosophy</strong><br></p>
<p>
  <ul>
  Books4Equality strives to decrease the cost of college education. Our principles are:
  <li>
  <strong>Affordability.</strong> The cost of textbooks have increased by 82% in the last decade. Today, students are spending an average of $1200 in books and supplies per year. With books4equality, your bills will be reduced.
  </li>
  <li>
  <strong>Equality.</strong> 65% of students decide against buying a textbook because of the price. With books4equality, the cost of the classes will not stop you from taking that extra class.
  </li>
  <li>
  <strong>Sustainability.</strong> Reducing the carbon footprint. The CO<sub>2</sub> resulting from the manufacture of all the textbooks used by students each year at UVM is equivalent to the CO<sub>2</sub> produced by a car travelling to the moon and back. 
  </li>
  </ul>

<p class="lead"> <strong>How did it start?</strong><br></p>
<p>
One day, while walking through campus, they noticed a large amount of books on a table that someone didn’t want. A conversation ensued about the incredible amount of money we had all paid for textbooks over our time at college, and how the majority were only used for that one class, and then just sat in our closets gathering dust. It was then that an idea was born and now we are looking for students to get behind it.

<p class="lead"> <strong>The situation</strong><br></p>
<p>
The skyrocketing cost of textbooks has caused students to spend on average of $1200 per year on books alone. This has forced many students to buy or rent used books, or as one study showed, 65% of students had forgone buying the book altogether, despite 94% claiming they were concerned not having the book would negatively affect their grades. Furthermore, it was shown that students were choosing which classes and how many classes they took based on the cost of the textbook. This is creating an educational inequality in American colleges and universities that we believe it is time to change. We don’t like paying too much for school. Books 4 Equality has been collecting hundreds of books from the University of Vermont since August of 2014. Professors and students alike have expressed interest and enthusiasm in helping the idea of the creation of a free textbook library. 
</p>
<p>
Student loan debt in the US has accumulated to $1.2 trillion. $1.2 TRILLION. We want to make a pay-it-forward campaign for textbooks. For college students, by college students. Free stuff is cool, free textbooks are even cooler.
